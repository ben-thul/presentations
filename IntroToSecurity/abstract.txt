How many times have you been told by your customers:

* "just grant db_owner/sysadmin to my application and it will work"
* "I need to be able to issue raw DML against these tables"
* "my login doesn't work the way it should!"
* "this query that is accessing objects in multiple databases isn't working"

In this session, we'll talk about ways to service requests like these without
having to give away the world.  Weâ€™ll start with authentication and
authorization, for context.

We will then go into different methods to augment the "normal" means of
obtaining permissions that will allow you to help your customers while at the
same time not needing to be overly permissive.

 
In the course of this presentation, you'll learn about:

    * Module signing
    * Permission chaining
    * Impersonation
    and more!
